Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I've long since wanted a 'Welcome page' for this, because the 'about me' text is way too sort, isn't it?

I've spent way too much time, polishing my [OpenStreetMap-Wiki-Page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/User:Kmpoppe), with every information about me, that's not directly programming-related.

### twofactorauth.org

Making the internet more secure, one website at a time - https://twofactorauth.org aims to list sites that do support 2-factor-authentication to prevent account takeovers.
* [TwoFactorAuth](https://github.com//2factorauth/twofactorauth)

### OpenStreetMap

I manage the GitHub organization [OSM-de](https://github.com/osm-de). It's there to gather the developers of the [OpenStreetMap Telegram Group](https://t.me/OSM_de).

This is what I sprung from my own creativity:

#### JOSM Plugins

* [NoteSolver](https://github.com/kmpoppe/noteSolver) allows you to solve a note at the same time you upload a change and thus creating links between both.
* [FHRSPlugin](https://github.com/kmpoppe/fhrsPlugin) can be used to look up FHRS information and add them to the respective OSM Primitive.

#### Other useful stuff

* [WebToOSMOH](https://github.com/OSM-de/WebToOSMOH) allows you to paste (almost) any website content that then figures out `opening_hours`.
* [NotesFeed](https://github.com/OSM-de/NotesFeed) creates a RSS-feed of the Notes that you have contributed to.

#### Contributions to other projects

* [Mapswipe](https://github.com/mapswipe/mapswipe) helps the Missing Maps project checking for noteworthy areas in remote locations.
