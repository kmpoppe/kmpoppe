Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I've spent way too much time polishing my [OpenStreetMap-Wiki-Page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/User:Kmpoppe), with every information about me, that's not directly programming-related - so head over there if you want to learn more about me.

### 2fa.directory

Making the internet more secure, one website at a time - https://2fa.directory aims to list sites that do support 2-factor-authentication to prevent account takeovers.
* [TwoFactorAuth](https://github.com//2factorauth/twofactorauth)

### OpenStreetMap

I manage the GitHub organization [OSM-de](https://github.com/osm-de). It's there to gather the developers of the [OpenStreetMap D-A-CH Telegram Group](https://t.me/OSM_de).

Things I would love you to give a try, should you need them:

#### JOSM Plugins

* [NoteSolver](https://github.com/kmpoppe/noteSolver) allows you to solve a note at the same time you upload a change and thus creating links between both.
* [FHRSPlugin](https://github.com/kmpoppe/fhrsPlugin) can be used to look up FHRS information and add them to the respective OSM Primitive.

#### Other useful stuff

* [WebToOSMOH](https://github.com/OSM-de/WebToOSMOH) allows you to paste (almost) any website content that then figures out `opening_hours`.
* [osm.org Greasemonkey]([https://github.com/OSM-de/](https://github.com/OSM-de/osm-org-greasemonkey)) will add loads of useful links when you're using openstreetmap.org in a browser that has Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Chrome) installed.

#### Contributions to other OSM-projects

* [Mapswipe](https://github.com/mapswipe/mapswipe) helps the Missing Maps project checking for noteworthy areas in remote locations.
* [StreetComplete](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete) - an Android app to work on mapping tasks while you're out and about.
* [OSM Community Index](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-community-index) - displaying local OSM communities on a [world map](https://openstreetmap.community)
